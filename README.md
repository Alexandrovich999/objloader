UI .OBJ Loader with physics

A simple UI that can load .obj models placed in garrysmod/data/models with or without physics.
i.e: Create a prop in Blender, spawn it without compiling into .mdl/restarting the game.

UI FEATURES

-Multiple models can be spawned (No limit)
-File browser to load models from garrysmod/data/models
-List of spawned models for individual selection/editing.
-XYZ position/pitch/yaw/roll/scale
-File browser to load models with PHYSICS (interacts only with the world)
-Reset position

USAGE

Place your OBJ models in garrysmod/data/models
Bind a key to "open_objloader_ui"/start in console
Load your OBJ model, no game restart required.
Spawn at crosshair with physics/static
Edit XYZ position/pitch/yaw/roll/scale of STATIC models only.
Mass is directly related to the triangle count.
The more complex the model, the heavier.


DISCLAIMER
This addon is unfinished and I may continue working on it in the future.
I don't know how to texture the .obj models/create physics that interact with entities not just the world.
Spawned models use models/debug/debugwhite texture
so feel free replace it with your model's (must convert to .vtf/.vmt)
and you should be able texture it. (Single texture)

Invert normals feature is broken. They are inverted by default.


Feel free to edit this addon if you'd like to finish it.
